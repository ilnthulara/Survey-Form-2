		<p class="paragraph">Climate change in Australia has been a critical issue since the beginning of the 21st
			century. Australia is becoming hotter and more prone to extreme heat, bushfires, droughts, floods, and
			longer fire seasons because of climate change. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Australia has
			experienced an increase of over 1.4 °C in average annual temperatures, with warming occurring at twice the
			rate over the past 50 years as in the previous 50 years. Recent climate events such as extremely high
			temperatures and widespread drought have focused government and public attention on the effects of climate
			change in Australia. Rainfall in southwestern Australia has decreased by 10–20% since the 1970s, while
			southeastern Australia has also experienced a moderate decline since the 1990s. Rainfall is expected to
			become heavier and more infrequent, as well as more common in summer rather than in winter. Water sources in
			the southeastern areas of Australia have depleted due to the increasing population in urban areas coupled
			with a persistent prolonged drought. Climate change is negatively affecting the continent's environment,
			economy, and communities. Australia is vulnerable to the effects of global warming projected for the next 50
			to 100 years because of its extensive arid and semi-arid areas, and already warm climate, high annual
			rainfall variability, and existing pressures on water supply. The continent's high fire risk increases this
			susceptibility to changes in temperature and climate. Furthermore, Australia's population is highly
			concentrated in coastal areas, and its important tourism industry depends on the health of the Great Barrier
			Reef and other fragile ecosystems. The impacts of climate change in Australia will be complex and to some
			degree uncertain, but increased foresight may enable the country to safeguard its future through planned
			mitigation and adaptation.</p>
